MIPSIM 1.0 currently contains 
a functional emulator for the MIPS architecture. 
The emulator reads ELF32 little-endian mips-linux
binaries and can simulate most of the SPEC Int and SPEC FP benchmarks.
(For most benchmarks, code should be compiled with a soft floating point
compiler.)

MIPSIM includes:
A built-in debugger.
A count of instructions of each type.

To install, untar the source by

tar xzvf mipsim.tar.gz
cd mipsim

then, pick an installation director <prefix>. The default <prefix> is the build/
directory under the current directory

./configure --prefix=<prefix> ( or simply ./configure )
make
make install

The <prefix>/bin directory will contain the binaries:
  emips - MIPS instruction set emulator
  emips_count - runs emips and returns instruction count
  emips_safe - runs emips with memory access permission checks

After installation, you can try to test the emulator by
<prefix>/bin/emips test/wc configure

Be sure to run the above command under the MIPSIM directory.

On Cygwin platforms, you may have to try 
CONFIG_SHELL=bash ./configure --prefix=<prefix>

Advanced configuration flags:
--enable-mmap
This will allow the emulator to use 4MB memory pages rather
than 4KB memory ones. The result is a 20% speed up of emips.

====================================================================
The emulator utilizes some important infrastructure code from the
PowerPC emulator by Gilles Mouchard (http://www.microlib.org).
